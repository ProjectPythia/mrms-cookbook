    "To provide hands-on experience in requesting and working with real-time MRMS data from AWS S3.\n",

    "### Audience\n",
    "- Users with at least **5 GB of memory** in their computing environment  \n",
    "- A basic familiarity with MRMS concepts is helpful, but not required  \n",
    "- No programming experience is necessary to run the notebook\n",
